# Employee Tracker

## Description
This command-line application helps the user (business owner) keep track of important information about their business such as departments, employees and job titles. Additionally, this application lets the user add a department, new roles, and new employees. 

In the future, I plan to make this application more functional by adding more features: 
- update employees
- delete departments, roles and employees 
- update employee managers 
- view employees by departments and managers
- view the total utilized budget of a department (view combined salaries of employees by department)

In order to build this application, I used skills such as `inquirer`, `MySQL`, and `mysql2` among others. The biggest challenge I faced in this project was setting up the prepared statements to add and update tables.
